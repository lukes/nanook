class Nanook
  # The <tt>Nanook::Wallet</tt> class lets you manage your nano wallets.
  # Your node will need the <tt>enable_control</tt> setting enabled.
  #
  # === Wallet seeds vs ids
  #
  # Your wallets each have an id as well as a seed. Both are 32-byte uppercase hex
  # strings that look like this:
  #
  #   000D1BAEC8EC208142C99059B393051BAC8380F9B5A2E6B2489A277D81789F3F
  #
  # This class uses wallet _ids_ to identify your wallet. A wallet id only
  # exists locally on the nano node that it was created on. The person
  # who knows this id can only perform all read and write actions against
  # the wallet and all accounts inside the wallet from the same nano node
  # that it was created on. This makes wallet ids fairly safe to use as a
  # person needs to know your wallet id as well as have access to run
  # RPC commands against your nano node to be able to control your accounts.
  #
  # A _seed_ on the other hand can be used to link any wallet to another
  # wallet's accounts, from anywhere in the nano network. This happens
  # by setting a wallet's seed to be the same as a previous wallet's seed.
  # When a wallet has the same seed as another wallet, any accounts
  # created in the second wallet will be the same accounts as those that were
  # created in the previous wallet, and the new wallet's owner will
  # also gain ownership of the previous wallet's accounts. Note, that the
  # two wallets will have different ids, but the same seed.
  #
  # Nanook is based on the Nano RPC, which uses wallet ids and not seeds.
  # The RPC and therefore Nanook cannot tell you what a wallet's seed is,
  # only its id. Knowing a wallet's seed is very useful for if you ever
  # want to restore the wallet anywhere else on the nano network besides
  # the node you originally created it on. The nano command line interface
  # (CLI) is the only method for discovering a wallet's seed. See the
  # {https://docs.nano.org/commands/command-line-interface/#-wallet_decrypt_unsafe-walletwallet-passwordpassword}.
  #
  # === Initializing
  #
  # Initialize this class through the convenient {Nanook#wallet} method:
  #
  #   nanook = Nanook.new
  #   wallet = nanook.wallet(wallet_id)
  #
  # Or compose the longhand way like this:
  #
  #   rpc_conn = Nanook::Rpc.new
  #   wallet = Nanook::Wallet.new(rpc_conn, wallet_id)
  class Wallet
    def initialize(rpc, wallet = nil)
      @rpc = rpc
      @wallet = wallet.to_s if wallet
    end

    # @return [String] the wallet id
    def id
      @wallet
    end

    # @param wallet [Nanook::Wallet] wallet to compare
    # @return [Boolean] true if wallets are equal
    def ==(wallet)
      wallet.class == self.class &&
        wallet.id == id
    end
    alias eql? ==

    # The hash value is used along with #eql? by the Hash class to determine if two objects
    # reference the same hash key.
    #
    # @return [Integer]
    def hash
      id.hash
    end

    # Returns the given account in the wallet as a {Nanook::WalletAccount} instance
    # to let you start working with it.
    #
    # Call with no +account+ argument if you wish to create a new account
    # in the wallet, like this:
    #
    #   wallet.account.create     # => Nanook::WalletAccount
    #
    # See {Nanook::WalletAccount} for all the methods you can call on the
    # account object returned.
    #

    #
    #   wallet.account("nano_...") # => Nanook::WalletAccount
    #   wallet.account.create     # => Nanook::WalletAccount
    #
    # @param account [String] optional String of an account (starting with
    #   <tt>"xrb..."</tt>) to start working with. Must be an account within
    #   the wallet. When no account is given, the instance returned only
    #   allows you to call +create+ on it, to create a new account.
