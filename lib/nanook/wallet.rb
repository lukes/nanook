class Nanook

  # The <tt>Nanook::Wallet</tt> class lets you manage your nano wallets,
  # as well as some account-specific things like making and receiving payments.
  #
  # Your wallets each have a seed, which is a 32-byte uppercase hex
  # string that looks like this:
  #
  #   000D1BAEC8EC208142C99059B393051BAC8380F9B5A2E6B2489A277D81789F3F
  #
  # You can think of this string as your API key to the nano network.
  # The person who knows it can do all read and write actions against
  # the wallet and all accounts inside the wallet from anywhere on the
  # nano network, not just on the node you created the wallet on.
  # <b>Make sure this key is always secret and safe</b>. Do not commit
  # your seed into source control.
  #
  # === Initializing
  #
  # Initialize this class through the convenient Nanook#wallet method:
  #
  #   nanook = Nanook.new
  #   wallet = nanook.wallet(wallet_seed)
  #
  # Or compose the longhand way like this:
  #
  #   rpc_conn = Nanook::Rpc.new
  #   wallet = Nanook::Wallet.new(rpc_conn, wallet_seed)
  class Wallet

    def initialize(rpc, wallet)
      @rpc = rpc
      @wallet = wallet
    end

    # A convenient method that returns an account in your wallet, allowing
    # you to perform all the actions in Nanook::WalletAccount on it.
    #
    #   wallet.account("xrb_...") #=> Nanook::WalletAccount instance
    #
    # See Nanook::WalletAccount.
    #
    # Will throw an ArgumentError if the wallet does not contain the account.
    #
    # ==== Arguments
    # [+account+] Optional String of an account (starting with
    #             <tt>"xrb..."</tt>) to start working with. Must be an
    #             account within the wallet. When
    #             no account is given, the instance returned only allows you to call
    #             +create+ on it, to create a new account. Otherwise, you
    #             must pass an account string for all other methods.
    #
    # ==== Examples
    #
    #   wallet.account.create      # Creates an account in the wallet and returns a Nanook::WalletAccount
    #   wallet.account(account_id) # Returns a Nanook::WalletAccount for the account
    def account(account=nil)
      Nanook::WalletAccount.new(@rpc, @wallet, account)
    end

    # Returns an Array with Strings of all account ids in the wallet.
    #
    # ==== Example response
    #
    #   [

    # wallet, optionally breaking the balances down by account.
    #
    # ==== Arguments
    #
    # [+account_break_down:+] Boolean (default is +false+). When +true+
    #                         the response will contain balances per
    #                         account.
    # [+unit:+]   Symbol (default is +:nano+) Represents the unit that
    #             the balances will be returned in.
    #             Must be either +:nano+ or +:raw+. (Note: this method
    #             interprets +:nano+ as NANO, which is technically Mnano
    #             See {What are Nano's Units}[https://nano.org/en/faq#what-are-nano-units-])

    #               (default is +nil+). When +nil+ this argument will not apply.
    #               The unit of +threshold+ is determined by the +unit:+ argument and defaults
    #               to NANO.
    # [+unit:+]   Symbol (default is +:nano+) Sets the unit of the +threshold:+ argument, and
