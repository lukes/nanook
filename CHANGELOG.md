## 1.0.0

### Added

- Added this CHANGELOG.md
- All classes have an `inspect` method
- New `id` method for `Nanook::Account`, `Nanook::Block`, `Nanook::Key` and `Nanook::Wallet` classes
- `Nanook::WalletAccount` class has an `account_id` and `wallet_id` method

  They take an argument `unit:` which can be set to `:raw` to have the
  balance return in raw units.
- All pay methods continue to take NANO as the default unit, but can now
  also take an argument `unit:` which can be set to `:raw` to have the
  `amount` argument be treated as being in raw instead of NANO.
