# Nanook

This is a Ruby library for managing a [nano currency](https://nano.org/) node, including making and receiving payments, using the [nano RPC protocol](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/wiki/RPC-protocol). Nano is a fee-less, fast, environmentally-friendly cryptocurrency. It's awesome. See [https://nano.org](https://nano.org/).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'nanook', "~> 1.0"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install nanook

# Getting Started

## Initializing

Nanook will by default connect to `http://localhost:7076`.

```ruby
nanook = Nanook.new
```

To connect to another host instead:

```ruby
nanook = Nanook.new("http://ip6-localhost:7076")
```

## Basics

### Working with wallets and accounts

Create a wallet:

```ruby
Nanook.new.wallet.create
```

Create an account within a wallet:

```ruby
Nanook.new.wallet(wallet_id).account.create
```

List accounts within a wallet:

```ruby
Nanook.new.wallet(wallet_id).accounts
```

### Sending a payment

To send a payment from an account in a wallet:

```ruby
account = Nanook.new.wallet(wallet_id).account(account_id)
account.pay(to: recipient_account_id, amount: 0.2, id: unique_id)
```

Or, a wallet:

```ruby
wallet = Nanook.new.wallet(wallet_id)
wallet.pay(from: your_account_id, to: recipient_account_id, amount: 0.2, id: unique_id)
```

The `id` can be any string and needs to be unique per payment. It serves an important purpose; it allows you to make this call multiple times with the same `id` and be reassured that you will only ever send that nano payment once. From the [Nano RPC](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/wiki/RPC-protocol#account-create):

> You can (and should) specify a unique id for each spend to provide idempotency. That means that if you [make the payment call] two times with the same id, the second request won't send any additional Nano.

The unit of the `amount` is NANO (which is currently technically Mnano &mdash; see [What are Nano's Units](https://nano.org/en/faq#what-are-nano-units-)). You can pass an amount of raw instead by adding the `unit: :raw` argument:

```ruby
account.pay(to: recipient_account_id, amount: 999, unit: :raw, id: unique_id)
```

Note, there may be a delay in receiving a response due to Proof of Work being done. From the [Nano RPC](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/wiki/RPC-protocol#account-create):

> Proof of Work is precomputed for one transaction in the background. If it has been a while since your last transaction it will send instantly, the next one will need to wait for Proof of Work to be generated.

### Receiving a payment

The simplest way to receive a payment is:

```ruby
account = Nanook.new.wallet(wallet_id).account(account_id)
account.receive

# or:

wallet = Nanook.new.wallet(wallet_id)
wallet.receive(into: account_id)
```

The `receive` method when called as above will receive the latest pending payment for an account in a wallet. It will either return a block hash if a payment was received, or `false` if there were no pending payments to receive.

You can also receive a specific pending block if you know it (you may have discovered it through calling `account.pending` for example):

```ruby
account = Nanook.new.wallet(wallet_id).account(account_id)
account.receive(block_id)

# or:

wallet = Nanook.new.wallet(wallet_id)
wallet.receive(block_id, into: account_id)
```

## All commands

Below is a quick reference list of commands. See the [full Nanook documentation](https://lukes.github.io/nanook/1.0.0/) for a searchable detailed description of every class and method, what the arguments mean, and example responses (Tip: expand the "**Nanook** < Object" item in the sidebar).

### Wallets

See the [full documentation for Nanook::Wallet](https://lukes.github.io/nanook/1.0.0/classes/Nanook/Wallet.html) for a detailed description of each method and example responses.

#### Create wallet:

```ruby
Nanook.new.wallet.create
```
#### Restoring a wallet from seed/id

If you previously created a wallet somewhere else, or if you rebuilt your node, you can restore the wallet:

```ruby
Nanook.new.wallet.restore(wallet_id)
```
Optionally also restore the wallet's accounts:
```ruby
Nanook.new.wallet.restore(wallet_id, accounts: 2)
```

#### Working with a single wallet:

```ruby
wallet = Nanook.new.wallet(wallet_id)

wallet.balance
wallet.balance(account_break_down: true)
wallet.balance(unit: :raw)
wallet.pay(from: your_account_id, to: recipient_account_id, amount: 2, id: unique_id)
wallet.pay(from: your_account_id, to: recipient_account_id, amount: 2, unit: :raw, id: unique_id)
wallet.pending
wallet.pending(limit: 1)
wallet.receive(into: account_id)
wallet.receive(pending_block_id, into: account_id)

wallet.account.create
wallet.accounts
wallet.contains?(account_id)

wallet.export
wallet.locked?
wallet.unlock(password)
wallet.change_password(password)

wallet.destroy
```
### Accounts

#### Create account:

```ruby
Nanook.new.wallet(wallet_id).account.create
```

#### Create multiple accounts:

```ruby
Nanook.new.wallet(wallet_id).account.create(5)
```

#### Working with a single account:

```ruby
account = Nanook.new.wallet(wallet_id).account(account_id)

account.balance
account.balance(unit: :raw)
account.pay(to: recipient_account_id, amount: 2, id: unique_id)
account.pay(to: recipient_account_id, amount: 2, unit: :raw, id: unique_id)
account.pending
account.pending(limit: 1)

```ruby
block = Nanook.new.block(block_id)

block.info                        # Verified blocks in the ledger
block.info(allow_unchecked: true) # Verified blocks AND unchecked synchronizing blocks

work_peers.clear
work_peers.list
```

### Keys

#### Create private public key pair:

```ruby
Nanook.new.key.generate
Nanook.new.key.generate(seed: seed, index: 0)
```

#### Working with a single key

```ruby
key = Nanook.new.key(private_key)

key.info
```

## Nanook Metal

You can do any call listed in the [Nano RPC](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/wiki/RPC-protocol) directly through the `rpc` method. The first argument should match the `action` of the RPC call, and then all remaining parameters are passed in as arguments.

E.g., the [accounts_create command](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/wiki/RPC-protocol#accounts-create) can be called like this:

```ruby
Nano.new.rpc(:accounts_create, wallet: wallet_id, count: 2)
```

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome. Pull requests with passing tests are even better.

To run the test suite:

    bundle exec rspec spec
